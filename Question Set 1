Q6. What is Cost Function?  

Q7. Gradient Descent?  

OPtimization Method that learns value of parameters that minimizes the cos function.  

Q8. Backpropagation?  
>> Move error from the end of the network to weights inside of the network  
>> Batch(update the weight using whole dataset in single iteration)  
>> Minibatch(Minibatches of training examples).  
>> stochastic(single training example)
